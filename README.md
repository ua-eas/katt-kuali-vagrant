## Synopsis

Kuali Vagrant is a project designed to standardize the developer workstation setup for the kuali applications technical team at the UofA. The plan is to use Vagrant http://www.vagrantup.com/ and KSI https://github.com/ua-eas/ksi to easily deploy local development instances of our Kuali applications while exactly mirroring the deployed environements. 

## Code Example

## Motivation

Some of the major driving forces for this effort are:

1. The current developer workstation setup is tedious and very time consuming. It sometimes takes days of configuration and troubleshooting to get an dev workstation setup.

2. We have seen several issues crop up lately that are hard to track down because we are not replicating the environment our apps are deployed too. Subtle things like different javamail.jar files, different builds of tomcat, and several other factors have made it very hard to replicate and track down issues.
